# -PA-LAB12

For this laboratory, we had to create an application to assist the user in building a Swing graphical user interface.
This is the compulsory part.

- The **MainFrame** class is the main class of the application. 
The frame contains a ControlPanel in the north and a DesignPanel in the center.

- The **ControlPanel** class allows the user to specify any class name of a Swing component, a default text for that component and a button for creating and adding an instance of the specified component to the DesignPanel.

- The **DesignPanel** class is using absolute positioning of its components and it contains Swing components added by our application in the ControlPanel.
